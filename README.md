# üìö JavaScript Arrays Practice

This project demonstrates various **array methods and operations** in JavaScript, helping understand how to create, modify, and manipulate arrays.

---

## ‚ú® Array Operations Explained

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Creating an Empty Array
An empty array is initialized using square brackets `[]`, and values are added using **index assignment**.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Accessing and Logging Array Elements
Individual elements can be accessed using **array indexing**, and the entire array can be logged directly.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Checking Array Length
The `.length` property returns the number of elements in the array.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Adding Elements
- `.push()` adds an element to the **end** of the array.
- `.unshift()` adds an element to the **start** of the array.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Removing Elements
- `.pop()` removes the **last** element from the array.
- `.shift()` removes the **first** element from the array.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Return Values
Both `.push()` and `.unshift()` return the **new length** of the array.  
Both `.pop()` and `.shift()` return the **removed element**.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Deleting Specific Elements
- `delete array[index]` removes the element but leaves an **empty slot** (undefined hole).
- `.splice(index, count)` removes **a specific number of elements starting at the given index**, without leaving a hole.

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Replacing Elements
`.splice()` can also replace elements by adding new data where old data was removed.

---

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Adding Elements at Specific Positions
`.splice()` can **insert new elements** without removing any existing elements by setting the remove count to `0`.

---

### üîü Slicing Arrays
`.slice(start, end)` creates a **new array** by copying part of the original array (without modifying the original).

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Reversing Arrays
`.reverse()` reverses the **order** of elements in the array.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Joining Array into String
`.join()` converts the array into a **string** with all elements joined by commas (or another separator if provided).

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Splitting Strings into Arrays
`.split()` (not shown in the code but related) can split a string into an array, which is often the reverse of `.join()`.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Combining Arrays
`.concat()` merges two arrays into a **new combined array**.

---

## üèÅ Purpose of This Practice
- To understand **basic array operations**.
- To practice using built-in **array methods**.
- To explore **adding, removing, slicing, and joining** array elements.
